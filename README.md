# One-way carsharing services in Vancouver

The obejctive of this project is to understand movements of one-way carsharing vehicles in Vancouver (Car2go and Evo).
The scripts access public websites which show all available vehicles in Vancouver and scrape the vehicle location and conditio data. Collected data is stored as two separate SQL databases for further analyses.


# Application
## What kind of mobility needs does one-way carsharing fuifill?
There is no study empirically shows what kind of mobility needs one-way carsharing services provide to the city residents. By visualizing carsharing vehicle movement, it becomes clear when and where these on-demand mobilities are used.

## Possibility of improving the service efficiency by relocating carsharing vehicles
There are higly likely unbalance between demand and supply of one-way carsharing cars. Some of the vehicles may be brought to a low service demand area and not used for a long period of time. Using vehicle location data, we may be able to suggest vehicle relocation strategires to imrpove the service efficiency.

## Rivals or compliements? two one-way carsharing services in Vancouver
Vancouver is a rare city to have two distinct one-way carsharing services. By looking at vehicle location data, we can tell if these two services complement each other or not.
